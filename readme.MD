# U THERE, SUN?

## Description

U there, Sun? is a static responsive web page were you can find weather info and local times of the default shown cities or any other by using the search bar.

## MVP

- Responsive web (mobile first, tablet, laptop)
- Organize the info in different sections as users wants
- Display the info from OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) in an user-friendly way.
- Have sign up and log in form (with validation format)
- Use the local storage

## Backlog

- Change background overlay colour depending on day/night condition.
- Find API to fetch pictures for the non-default cities and use them as background.
- A way for users to store their cities in their personal area for quick access.
- Logo.


## Tech Challenge

- Doing a good responsive web and being able to connect with the API successfully.

## Data structure

Users data will be obtained from the sign up form and will be stored in browser's local storage. The log in form will look for the data in the local storage which should match with the info provided by the user.

## Wireframes
